João Pereira dos Santos is a Chemical Engineer specialized in Processes and Product from FEUP.

During his degree, he won the 2018 Academic Games of Engineering by AEFEUP: a group project aiming at designing a continuous hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) biomass processing unit for Paralab, SA; and was also 3x Team Leader at the European BEST Engineering Competition Challenge - Team Design: a practical test consisting on the construction of a prototype with limited materials and low cost to solve a proposed problem.

As a Data Science enthusiast, João is intellectually curious and eager to learn and apply new Data-Oriented skill sets into daily challenges. During his MSc Thesis Project regarding "Qualitative and Quantitative Analysis in Copper Electroplating Baths", KPIs for Chemical Process Control were implemented on a Microsoft Power BI Dashboard. He started competing in begginer Kaggle Competitions and participated on the 2020 EUREKAthon - Challenge Data for Zero Hunger: a data-driven competition that addresses societal issues associated with sustainable development goals.

Highlighted Courses: Process Strategy and Optimization; Process Dynamics and Control; Oil Refining and Petrochemistry; Industrial Informatics II; Entrepreneurship and Innovation; Engineering Project.

Highlighted MOOC: Complete Data Science Bootcamp 2020 by 365 Data Science; Process Mining Expert by Celonis.
